(raw_image.png)
Orthomosaic Dataset of RGB aerial images for Weed Mapping and Segmentation and its Ground Truth (GT).
It depicts a sugar cane plantation in Northern Brazil, captured as a single UAV-acquired sugarcane field orthomosaic.
The image was captured from an Horus Aeronaves (https://horusaeronaves.com/) fixed-wing UAV employing a visible light RGB Canon G9X camera.
The UAV captured the data following a flight altitude of 125 to 200 meters, resulting in an approximate  spatial resolution of 5cm/pixel.

From the dataset an expert biologist produced a human-made ground truth (GT).
The expert classified the whole image manually, using the GNU image manipulation program (GIMP). 
All pixels of the image were classified into three classes: crop row (green), weed (yellow) and background (red).
Out-of-boundaries pixels are black. 
This GT representation allows the direct usage of the GT in machine learning environments that employ the Pascal VOC standard.
